This repo is for making the "Violin Tone" app.

The idea is that the child will play one long sustained note, while the changing chords in their headphones will make it interesting.

Done:	put some basic synths in
		make a system for recording and storing interesting chords.

ToDo:	record some Chords!
		make a playback system, with timing, and crossfades between chords.
		make the system work for all 4 violin strings.

Eventually:  add fiddle so that it will work according to which string is played automatically
